				A striking, compact light with a simple, organic design, Pin-Up opens like a shell to provide a bright light and the quality of LED lighting. A light that can be modelled at will thanks to the flexibility of the light fixture and the availability of two LED sources.

									
					
						Simple elegance which encloses the light like a shell with its pearl. Designed by Andrea Tosetto, Pin-Up is an elegant compact light fixture which surprises with the different light effects projected on the wall or ceiling. It has a steel structure consisting of a part fixed to the wall and a mobile part with a glass lens which contains a dimmable LED. When closed, Pin-Up emanates a soft and delicate light; when the upper part is tilted up to 90° and the structure rotated up to 355°, it creates plays of light which vary in intensity. Its excellent flexibility and three finishes, in matte white, coppery bronze and matte black, allows it to fit perfectly into a variety of settings.
 
Pin-Up is available with warmer (2700 K) or colder light (3000 K). The light is diffused through a convex glass lens which prevents the glare of direct light. With its elegant simplicity, Pin-Up is perfect for use as an instant bedside reading light, ideal as a light source on a staircase or in a corridor and versatile enough to light up the wall in a living room.","","","taxable","","1","","","0","0","","","","","1","","","","Collections, Wall","lodes","","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pin-Up-06.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pin–Up_coppery-bronze.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pin–Up_matte-white.jpg","","","","","","","","","0","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/155IS40E0001_Rev00_CE_PRINT.pdf","10 variants available"

				Volum celebrates the elegance of simplicity with a series of lamps that, in their similar yet intimately different shapes, complement each other in poetic compositions that narrate an all-round illumination, tailored for various functions and uses. Behind its apparent simplicity, the collection designed in collaboration with architectural firm Snøhetta conceals a complex technical achievement, paying homage to the ancient glassblowing technique that gives life to naturally imperfect shapes. The blown glass spheres of the diffuser, available in diameters of 14, 22, 29, and 42 cm, feature a glossy white finish that evenly radiates light.

									
					
						
The Volum family includes various models – cluster suspension, ceiling, wall, table, and floor lamps – that enhance any space and situation, whether used individually or in compositions to create original lighting solutions.","","","taxable","","1","","","0","0","","","","","1","","","","Collections, Ceiling","lodes","","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Volum-New-10.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Volum-New-08.jpg","","","","","","","","","0","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/209IS40E0001_Rev00_CE_PRINT.pdf","16 variants available"

				With a strong personality and a sculptural form reminiscing the shape of bells, Easy Peasy is a set of portable and rechargeable table lamps, consisting of two rounded elements, a body and a knob. Made of blown glass, Easy Peasy allows for personal customisation of the living spaces. Its portability, different shapes and colours, and the dim-to-warm functionality of its light source allow users to connect, play and interact with the variable configuration options.

									
					
						Like a set of friendly characters reminiscent of dolls, Easy Peasy portable and rechargeable lamps reflect in their name a playful spirit. With a sculptural design that aims for minimal elegance through rounded shapes and eclectic colour combinations, Easy Peasy portable lamp adds warmth and character to any environment.
 
Available in four colour combinations, each lamp is composed of two elements, a body and a pommel. The body of the lamp features a metal base housing the LED light source and a white methacrylate diffuser wrapped by a glass bell. The glass filters the light and comes in two different shapes and colours. On top, a rounded pommel allows to turn the lamp on and off and to dim the intensity and warmth of the light. The dim-to-warm function makes Easy Peasy the perfect choice for an intimate and familiar atmosphere in domestic settings as well as in hotels and restaurants.
 
Easy Peasy surprises with its wealth of details, combining senses and functions. The tactile diversity of its surfaces, in which shiny and transparent, metal and glass coexist in a captivating contrast, is accentuated by sophisticated and contemporary colour combinations, while the pommel is the key element in which colours, innate gestures and the control of technological functions coexist. A micro-USB socket at the base of the body is provided to recharge the battery. More than a lamp, it is a lively companion that warms any room with luminous intimacy.","","","taxable","","1","","","0","0","","","","","1","","","","Collections, Table","lodes","","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Easy-Peasy-08.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Easy-Peasy-05.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Easy-Peasy-01.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Easy-Peasy-02.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Easy-Peasy-04.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Easy-Peasy-07.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Easy-Peasy-lagoon_2.jpg","","","","","","","","","0","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IST-17001_Rev01_PRINT.pdf","20 variants available"

				The name Flar evokes images of a flare or ‘flamboiement’ in French – an intense blaze or burst of light. Highly impactful in its simplicity, Flar is a floor and table lamp that does not go unnoticed.

									
					
						
Inspired by traditional storm lanterns which use glass pipes to protect the flame, Flar features a billowing glass shade designed to surround an LED filament bulb, to magnify the light source and diffuse a very soft light, filtered by the tinted glass, almost like a contemporary candle.
 
Flar comprises a steel base which opens like a flower, leading to a moulded blown glass shade. The contrast between the precise 3D laser cut base and the uniqueness of the blown glass bubble enhances the personality of the lamp.
 
Flar is available in two sizes: Large, 62.5 cm tall, and Medium, measuring 47 cm. The 3D laser-cut steel base is available in Terra and Champagne finishes, while the blown glass diffuser is available in two colours, Honey and Turquoise. The power cord is black, with a dimmer switch.
 
The Flar collection suits different uses such as on a low console table or next to a sofa. Together, the two sizes offer an opportunity to play with scale to create a unique composition for a hotel lounge or retail space.","","","taxable","","1","","","0","0","","","","","1","","","","Collections, Floor","lodes","","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Flar-02.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Flar-03.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Flar-04.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Flar-05.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Flar-07.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Flar_large-and-medium_terrahoney-champagneturquoise.jpg","","","","","","","","","0","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/191IS80E0001_Rev00_CE._PRINT.pdf","30 variants available"

				A lightweight, blown glass suspension lamp, Random is made up of three round diffusers of different sizes which form one simple, eye-catching whole. Each diffuser has an LED light source which emits a soft white light. When grouped together on a cluster, Random light fixtures form a poetic composition like soap bubbles, enhanced by the contemporary finishes which add a touch of character and originality.

									
					
						
Designed by Chia-Ying Lee, Random conjures up images of frothy bubbles dancing playfully in the wind. Random emulates the ephemeral nature of bubbles with perfectly smooth blown glass that is resistant to temperature fluctuations. Slender metal wires support the three spheres measuring 18, 14 and 12 cm in diameter. A thin metal cylinder houses the cables of each sphere and creates a cluster of lights. Random experiences a modification of the driver, which must be housed in the canopy.
 
Suspended on the power cord, Random diffuses a soft light with warmer (2700k) or colder (3000k) colour temperature* emitted by the three 1W LEDs, one for each of the three blown glass spheres. The LED light source is positioned in a silicone seat in the upper part of the light. The colour rendering index (CRI) of 90 retains the true colour of objects.
 
The innate playful nature of Random conjures up emotion-filled light effects. It can be used on its own to illuminate a table or in clusters to light larger areas in the home. With a choice of seven colour options, Random interprets the concept of a random composition in a creative and fun way. The different finishes offer ample freedom in composing sets of effervescent blends of light creating a dynamic dialogue with the setting in which they are suspended.","","","taxable","","1","","","0","0","","","","","1","","","","Collections, Cluster suspension","lodes","","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Random-02.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Random-01-1.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Random-2025-01.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Random-2025-02.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Random-cluster-suspension-25-01.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Random_glossy-bronze-chrome.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Random-cluster-suspension-25-02.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Random-01A-22.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Random-02-1.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Random-03-1.jpg","","","","","","","","","0","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/164IS10E0001_Rev01_CE_PRINT.pdf","29 variants available"

				Essential forms in metal, square and rectangular, which seem to disappear in the ceiling or wall. In Puzzle lamps, light becomes the feature element of living spaces, creating soft, geometric effects.

									
					
						Clean and geometric lines merge with the walls or ceiling, lighting them up with soft and welcoming light. Puzzle lamps play with shapes, composed in three different versions: single and double square, rectangle and square. The play continues thanks to the possibility to position Puzzle wherever preferred based on the available space, and to create highly personalised light effects. Thanks to the two neutral tone finishes in matte white and matte black, their discrete style instils a pleasant atmosphere in different areas of the home, from the living room to the bedroom.
 
The 15W LED light source (2 × 15W in the double versions) is housed in the inner side of the aluminium body, configured to facilitate heat dispersion. Just like a mirror, the inside of the lamp body amplifies the reflection of the light on the wall. The light temperature is available with a warmer (2700K) or colder tone (3000K). The colour rendering index (CRI) of 92 mirrors the true colour of objects without distorting them. The essential forms of Puzzle lamps sit perfectly in spaces characterised by a distinctly modern style, creating harmonious and soothing background lighting.","","","taxable","","1","","","0","0","","","","","1","","","","Collections, Ceiling","lodes","","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Puzzle-Soffitto-01.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Puzzle-Soffitto-02.jpg","","","","","","","","","0","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/146IS40E0001_Rev00_CE_PRINT.pdf","21 variants available"

				Lodes and internationally renowned artist and designer Ron Arad have joined forces to create Cono di Luce, a one-of-a-kind suspension lamp that combines the former’s cutting-edge expertise with the latter’s creativity.

									
					
						
The technology enclosed in Cono di Luce defines its identity. Using a flexible printed circuit board in a groundbreaking way, encapsulated within an element as simple as a transparent Pyrex® cone, the lamp exudes a dualism between on and off that is easily discernible.
 
The frame, also made of PCB, thanks to its 1.6 mm thickness, has several functions: to provide support for the lamp and enable it to be switched on, as well as to keep the PCB sheet in the right position.
 
When illuminated, Cono di Luce reveals its true decorative essence, boasting an optical interplay of lights, shadows, and overlapping patterns that showcase the designer’s creative flair and Lodes’ renowned manufacturing expertise.
 
It is available in three frame finishes: red, grey and gold, and in two variants, table and suspension.
 
Cono di Luce is proposed as a design element for sophisticated environments, embodying the values shared by Lodes and Ron Arad: to create a collection that is both accessible and highly efficient in light.","","","taxable","","1","","","0","0","","","","","1","","","","Collections, Table","lodes","","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Cono-di-Luce-06.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Cono-di-Luce-07.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Cono-di-Luce-10.jpg","","","","","","","","","0","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/210IS80E0001_Rev00_PRINT.pdf","10 variants available"

				Laser is a compact, versatile light fixture in the shape of a box with an attractive architectural look. From its painted steel structure, available in three different finishes, the LED light source diffuses a functional and evocative two-way light that creates plays of light and shadow on the wall.

									
					
						A simple geometric shape which makes a bold statement in areas where light is the protagonist. Laser measures 10 × 10 cm and has a painted metal structure available in three different finishes: matte white, matte black and champagne.

Laser is mounted flush to wall and emits warm or cold light. The light fixture is fitted with a 16W LED whose colour rendering index (CRI) of 92 offers true colour reproduction. The aluminium heatsink inside the light fixture optimises the performance of the LED. Thanks to its compact size and high-performance light, Lase blends seamlessly into a wide variety of spaces.

						 Geometric, soft and ductile forms transform light into a malleable essence to be diffused on the walls and ceiling. Puzzle Round allows the personalisation of internal lighting, adjusting it at will thanks to the structure fitted with flexible joints, allowing the lamp to be tilted by 85° and rotated up to 355°. Housing a LED light inside, Puzzle Round allows the development of ever-changing plays of light, which are doubled in the Double Round version.

				Random Stick brings the collection of the same name designed by Chia-Ying Lee into the horizontal dimension with a suspension lamp that is both essential and highly decorative. The poetic blown-glass spheres, perfect in their smooth surfaces, rest on a hexagonal bar with strong aesthetic appeal, almost as if they were fragile soap bubbles grazing the surface before taking flight again.
Lodes has crafted a highly functional piece by placing LEDs on the underside of the bar. This design choice complements the light already diffused by the spheres and ensures uniform downward illumination, making it ideal for lighting surfaces below.
Random Stick is available in two versions: the 100 cm model with four spheres and two LEDs, suitable for placement above a dining table or desk; and the 150 cm model with six spheres and three LEDs, perfect for illuminating longer surfaces like a cocktail bar counter or in retail settings, and it can also be installed in multiples.
The spheres come in seven finishes from the Random collection, which can be freely combined on bars available in glossy gold, glossy black, and matte white, allowing for original colour play and fun lighting effects that highlight the concept of randomness and evanescence, reminiscent of bubbles. The numerous combinations possible by mixing the colours of the bars and spheres result in diverse characters and lighting effects, from bold tones and striking contrasts to subtle tone-on-tone nuances, enabling you to create the perfect solution to suit the style of any room.
Thanks to its design and the option to configure it with a special canopy, specifically created for this type of pendant lamp, Random Stick can also be installed in spaces where the light point is not centrally located.","","","taxable","","1","","","0","0","","","","","1","","","","Collections, Suspension","lodes","","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/RandomStick-6.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/RandomStick-1.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/RandomStick-2.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/RandomStick-3.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/RandomStick-4.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/23420M-2230U17110V-4317111V-1317112V-4617110V-43.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/23420M-5030U17110V-4317111V-0017112V-4017110V-00.jpg","","","","","","","","","0","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Lodes-Random-Stick-long.pdf","36 variants available"

				Taking its name from the Italian word for a ‘quaver’ or ‘eighth’, the floor lamp Croma reflects the dynamism of the musical note in its slender frame. In contrast to the classic floor lamp, which typically opens out at the top, Luca Nichetto turned the frame on its head to create a revolutionary product. Immediate in its function, elegant in the four available finishes, Croma’s powerful light output and dim-to-warm function make it suitable for a variety of environments.

									
					
						
Croma’s slender metal frame, which dispels washes of light upwards across the wall and ceiling, reflects the dynamism of the musical note from which it derives its name.
Reaching 186cm in total, the floor lamp designed by Luca Nichetto features a conical base that provides stability and a sleek body which casts a powerful ray of light from its LED source. A ring conveniently positioned halfway up the stem allows the user to switch the lamp on and off, and to utilise its dim to warm function, which extends from 2200 to 3200 kelvin.
Croma is available in four unique finishes. The metallic ombré effects fade from green to black and from bronze to nickel, their gradient referencing the way the light can radiate upwards against a wall. The two matte shades, in solid white and black, have a texturised finish that would be well suited to any residential and commercial setting.
Croma is an elegant yet striking product that embodies Lodes’ ethos – considered design with powerful and personalised lighting that prioritises the end user.","","","taxable","","1","","","0","0","","","","","1","","","","Collections, Floor","lodes","","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Croma-9.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Croma-1-1.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Croma-5-1.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Croma-2_green.jpg","","","","","","","","","0","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IST-17201_Rev00_CE.pdf","9 variants available"

				Six perfect spheres floating in the air like gentle glass bubbles. Random Solo revisits the concept of the Random suspension lamp by parting the original three-piece cluster and releasing the individuality of the spherical shapes, which float like bubbles of light, letting you imagine compositions of luminous harmonies.

				Kelly Cluster spectacularly reinterprets the creative intuition of the family of Kelly lights in a sculptural and extremely compact sphere, mounted on a canopy and allowing multiple different compositions at will. A suspension lamp in metal, characterised by its lightness and vibrancy thanks to the unique laser cuts that create captivating plays of light and shadow, it is available in four different finishes bringing any space to life.

									
					
						Lightweight and sculptural, Kelly Cluster is a delicate suspended sphere with a high visual impact not only by way of its appearance, but also its luminous effect. Recalling the decorative motif of the Kelly family, it is characterised by original patterns achieved through precision laser cuts, thus casting the light and creating an intriguing play of light and shadow. When off, its sophisticated patterns become a source of fascination, making this a genuine furnishing object with a truly scenic effect.
 
Kelly Cluster is a compact metal sphere with a diameter of 18 cm, which houses a semi-transparent glass diffuser in glossy milk white. The light, which is evenly diffused, underscores the elegance of the laser workmanship, filtering through the empty spaces. Suspended from a thin power cord up to 4 metres long, it appears to float in the air, diffusing a warm light emitted by a 7W LED source. The colour rendering index (CRI) of 90 retains the true colour of objects.
 
Kelly Cluster is designed to create surprising cluster compositions either in a single colour or else combining the four finishes: matte champagne, matte white, matte black and coppery bronze. The numerous available canopies allow an endless variety of Kelly Cluster compositions in both residential and public contexts, but also particularly suited to large architectural spaces.","","","taxable","","1","","","0","0","","","","","1","","","","Collections, Cluster suspension","lodes","","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kelly-Cluster-01.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kelly-Cluster-02.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kelly-Cluster-03.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kelly-Cluster_matte-black-and-matte-champagne.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kelly-cluster_white-and-coppery-bronze_1.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kelly-cluster_white-and-coppery-bronze.jpg","","","","","","","","","0","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/147IS10E0001_Rev02_CE_PRINT.pdf","13 variants available"

				IVY is a minimal, geometric lighting piece composed of a ring hanging on a cable, which gives power to a made to measure LED module. Designed with single and double cables (IVY I and IVY V respectively), IVY responds to the need for flexibility, an increasingly contemporary theme in architectural practice and restoration, allowing the luminaire to be released from its ceiling derivation.

									
					
						
The name IVY relates to the clustering of lamps on numerous cables that are reminiscent of climbing branches. The cables intertwine and overlap in the same way as the plant ivy, adapting to the environment and framing certain details of the space. The composition emphasises various focal points from different or changing points of view of those who walk through the room.
 
The design was also inspired by rings, specifically wedding rings, as pendants on necklaces. This motif translates to the ring’s position on the double cable, reinforcing it as a simple yet precious object, making the perfection of its form the value.
 
IVY I is a single pendant lamp with a single cable supporting the ring, which can be used on its own or in compositions on Lodes canopies.
 
IVY V, on the other hand, opens new territory with its new canopy. IVY V features a double cable which forms a V by hanging the cable from the power source in the ceiling to wherever users decide to fix it. IVY V can also be used on a new multiple canopy that consists of a base with a central hole from which up to 6 or 12 cables hang. Users can create several V shapes, starting from the canopy and positioning the cable wherever they want around the room, securing it to the ceiling through a small black metal element.
 
The cable is black, while the die-cast zinc alloy ring comes in three finishes: matte black, extra-matte champagne and terra. IVY sheds light downward through a long and narrow opening, which has been skilfully designed to disseminate an even, rounded beam through its methacrylate diffuser.
 
IVY is a true space architecture project, with the cables becoming a graphic sign that defines the space.","","","taxable","","1","","","0","0","","","","","1","","","","Collections, Cluster suspension","lodes","","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IVY-02.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IVY-03.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IVY-07.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IVY-06.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IVY-I-and-V_-matte-champagne-and-terra.jpg","","","","","","","","","0","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/178IS10E0001_Rev03_CE_PRINT.pdf","10 variants available"

				Lodes and internationally renowned artist and designer Ron Arad have joined forces to create Cono di Luce, a one-of-a-kind suspension lamp that combines the former’s cutting-edge expertise with the latter’s creativity.

									
					
						
The technology enclosed in Cono di Luce defines its identity. Using a flexible printed circuit board in a groundbreaking way, encapsulated within an element as simple as a transparent Pyrex® cone, the lamp exudes a dualism between on and off that is easily discernible.
 
The frame, also made of PCB, thanks to its 1.6 mm thickness, has several functions: to provide support for the lamp and enable it to be switched on, as well as to keep the PCB sheet in the right position.
 
When illuminated, Cono di Luce reveals its true decorative essence, boasting an optical interplay of lights, shadows, and overlapping patterns that showcase the designer’s creative flair and Lodes’ renowned manufacturing expertise.
 
It is available in three frame finishes: red, grey and gold, and in two variants, table and suspension.
 
Cono di Luce is proposed as a design element for sophisticated environments, embodying the values shared by Lodes and Ron Arad: to create a collection that is both accessible and highly efficient in light.","","","taxable","","1","","","0","0","","","","","1","","","","Collections, Cluster suspension","lodes","","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Cono-di-Luce-03.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Cono-di-Luce-05.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Cono-di-Luce-08.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Cono-di-Luce-09.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Cono-di-Luce-01.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Cono-di-Luce-02.jpg","","","","","","","","","0","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/210IS10E0001_Rev00_PRINT.pdf","20 variants available"

				Seductive beauty with a bold personality thanks to the strong and precise laser cuts, which lighten the metal of the lampshade and create an intriguing play of light and shadow. Kelly is a multifaceted family of suspension and wall lamps that stand out with elegance in any living space thanks to the variety of available forms and finishes.

									
					
						Strong geometric forms and lightweight clusters characterised by special laser cuts that make way for a dynamic play of light and shadow. Made in metal, thanks to their distinct patterns, Kelly suspension and wall lamps are eye-catching even when off, becoming decorative objects that personalise the space.
 
The graphic pattern is the common denominator in this variegated family of lamps. Shaped like a dome, Kelly Dome features a lightweight lampshade with a strong visual impact. Available in three sizes – 50, 60 and 80 cm – and in four elegant finishes, it is particularly suited for lighting up the dining table or to create atmosphere in the living room. The contemporary style of Kelly Sphere, similarly available in three different sizes – 40, 50 and 80 cm – emanates a sense of simplicity and lightness with a touch of magic. In the wall version featured with a width of 25 cm, Kelly helps to create a warm and welcoming atmosphere even in the smallest of spaces.
 
Kelly Dome and Kelly Sphere are suspended from the ceiling by way of three steel cables that keep them perfectly balanced. Inside, a semi-transparent glass diffuser in glossy milk white is designed to house E27 lamps (not included). The wall version includes a 16W LED source with warm light and colour rendering index (CRI) of 92.

				Essential forms in metal, square and rectangular, which seem to disappear in the ceiling or wall. In Puzzle lamps, light becomes the feature element of living spaces, creating soft, geometric effects.

									
					
						Clean and geometric lines merge with the walls or ceiling, lighting them up with soft and welcoming light. Puzzle lamps play with shapes, composed in three different versions: single and double square, rectangle and square. The play continues thanks to the possibility to position Puzzle wherever preferred based on the available space, and to create highly personalised light effects. Thanks to the two neutral tone finishes in matte white and matte black, their discrete style instils a pleasant atmosphere in different areas of the home, from the living room to the bedroom.
 
The 16W LED light source (2 × 16W in the double versions) is housed in the inner side of the aluminium body, configured to facilitate heat dispersion. Just like a mirror, the inside of the lamp body amplifies the reflection of the light on the wall. The light temperature is available with a warmer (2700K) or colder tone (3000K). The colour rendering index (CRI) of 92 mirrors the true colour of objects without distorting them. The essential forms of Puzzle lamps sit perfectly in spaces characterised by a distinctly modern style, creating harmonious and soothing background lighting.","","","taxable","","1","","","0","0","","","","","1","","","","Collections, Wall","lodes","","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Puzzle-Wall-01.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Puzzle-Wall-03.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Puzzle-Wall-04.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Puzzle-Wall-05.jpg","","","","","","","","","0","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IST-14601_Rev01_CE_PRINT.pdf","21 variants available"

						A-Tube is a lamp characterised by an elegant, cylindrical design, perfect for illuminating specific points and furnishing with dynamic essentiality. Available in two versions, ceiling and suspension, it can be used either singularly or to create lively compositions distinguished by their differing lengths and finishes (matte white, matte black and coppery bronze). As a central feature with multiform lighting, in a neat row over a bench or in a rhythmic succession of different sized lines, A-Tube illuminates, becoming one with the interior architecture.
 
The aluminium body of A-Tube, with a diameter of 6 cm, is 4 mm thick, making it both solid and resilient. Inside, its structure is designed to house a GU10 lamp that diffuses direct light. The ceiling version, available in four sizes (14, 30, 60, 100 cm), can easily be fixed with a simple metal attachment. The suspension version comes in three different lengths, 30, 60 and 100 cm, which can be used as single pendants or combined on canopies to create multiple compositions.","","","taxable","","1","","","0","0","","","","","1","","","","Collections, Ceiling","lodes","","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A-Tube-Ceiling-01.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A-Tube-Ceiling-02.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A-Tube-3.jpg","","","","","","","","","0","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/096IS30E0001_REV03_CE_PRINT.pdf","28 variants available"

				Kinno is a bollard that enhances the beauty of outdoor spaces by blending harmoniously into the landscape. Its design features biomorphic shapes and curves inspired by plant forms which, according to the principles of biophilia, convey a sense of comfort and wellbeing, encouraging a visual, sensory and emotional connection with nature.

									
					
						
The elegant silhouette evokes the shape of a mushroom – hence the name Kinno, which means ‘mushroom’ in Japanese – and plays with visual perception to suggest the imperfect harmony of the natural world. The cap, which appears perfectly circular from above, reveals a soft irregularity when viewed from other angles, emphasising its organic design. Similarly, the radial slats – deliberately inserted beneath the cap – create a natural, unexpected effect that is echoed in the stem, available in either a straight or curved version, adding a sense of movement and spontaneity to the lighting composition.
 
Kinno is available in five finishes – black, anthracite, natural brown, natural green and champagne – evoking the tones of the plant world, paired with more neutral hues to suit a variety of settings. This contributes to a multisensory aesthetic that enhances green spaces through the interplay of light, material and nature.","","","taxable","","1","","","0","0","","","","","1","","","","Outdoor","lodes","","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Lodes-Outdoor-Kinno-5.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Lodes-Outdoor-Kinno-6.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Lodes-Outdoor-Kinno-1-1.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Lodes-Outdoor-Kinno-2-1.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Lodes-Outdoor-Kinno-3-1.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Lodes-Outdoor-Kinno-4.jpg","","","","","","","","","0","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Kinno-SpecSheets.pdf","41 variants available"

				A-Tube Nano reinterprets the A-Tube collection with a lamp that expresses light in its purest form, tracing an elegant luminous line in space As thin as a pin, it draws its intrinsic strength from the simplicity of a graphic element, the line, which gently defines the atmosphere with a design that is as simple and light as it is refined and functional.

									
					
						
At the lower end of the slender aluminium structure, which measures only 2 cm in diameter, is a small transparent methacrylate diffuser housing an LED module: this makes the light point appear almost suspended in the air.
 
The ultra-slim silhouette of A-Tube Nano is offered in three lengths – Small, Medium, and Large – and six finishes, ranging from glossy tones for a contemporary elegance to matte colours for more minimalist interiors.
In the ceiling-recessed version, A-Tube Nano allows for the light beam to be directed at will, thanks to the joint angle of the lamp body, which enables the thin aluminium structure to be easily adjusted by up to 30° to direct the light onto specific details or emphasise the scenic effect of a composition with multiple elements.
 
In addition to offering new compositional applications, the recessed version allows for lighting solutions that meet specific design needs, such as lively rhythms – achieved by repeating a single size and directing the light beams in various directions – or more dynamic patterns – created by alternating the different sizes – ideal for illuminating lobbies or entrances to large public spaces.
 
In the pendant version, A-Tube Nano can be used individually to illuminate a romantic table for two or medium-sized tables in a bistro; in compositions, it allows for free combinations of finishes and lengths, even alternating the two versions to create evocative and customised lighting solutions that define the atmosphere of any space, from a designer restaurant to the living area of a contemporary home, or an airport lounge or hotel lobby. The versatility of the pendant version extends to the cable from which it is delicately","","","taxable","","1","","","0","0","","","","","1","","","","Collections, Ceiling","lodes","","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/A–Tube-Nano-Swing-Ceiling-03.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/A–Tube-Nano-Swing-Ceiling-04.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/A–Tube-Nano-Swing-Ceiling-05.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/A–Tube-Nano-Swing-Ceiling-06.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/A–Tube-Nano-Swing-Ceiling-01.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/A–Tube-Nano-Swing-Ceiling-02.jpg","","","","","","","","","0","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/158IS30E0001_Rev00_CE_print.pdf","75 variants available"

				Oblò is a pendant lamp with a distinctly decorative character that combines Lodes’ expertise in versatile and modular lighting solutions with the unique and distinctive personality of Paola Navone – OTTO Studio. With its playful spirit and numerous references to the sea and the nautical world, Oblò evokes marine imagery and offers new insights into the use of Pyrex in lighting, shaping it like a liquid material into the product’s fluid silhouette.

									
					
						
The frame supporting the diffuser is shaped like a hook, to which a white cloth-covered cable is knotted: Lodes ingeniously concealed the electrical wiring within the fabric cable and the LED within the hook, leaving only the glass visible, creating the impression that the lamp floats in the air like a buoy.
Oblò is available in three gentle forms and five finishes reminiscent of the marine world – iridescent, metallic blue, silk white, smoky grey, and transparent – highlighting the metallisation process that enhances the diffuser glass. It offers high luminosity even when installed on its own, serving as an elegant light point above a coffee table or beside a bathroom cabinet. In group compositions, different shapes and finishes can play with alternating rhythms and movements, thanks to the ability to install the lamps at various heights. This versatility makes it suitable for any space and situation, from compositions of two or three elements in private homes and restaurants to large cascades of light above long tables or expansive living areas.","","","taxable","","1","","","0","0","","","","","1","","","","Collections, Cluster suspension","lodes","","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Oblo_largemedium_rainbowazuresteel.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/17-Oblo-small-medium-and-large.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Oblo_smal-azure-steel_large-clear.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Oblo_silk-white.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Oblo_large-silkwhite_small-glossysmoke_medium-clear.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Oblo_small-clear.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Oblo_rainbow.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/12-Oblo-small-and-medium_Clear-and-Silk-White.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Oblo_large_azuresteel.jpg","","","","","","","","","0","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/218IS10E0001_Rev00_CE_print.pdf","63 variants available"

				Shift is a wall lamp with impressive luminous power. Designed by Marco Piva, it redefines the concept of a wall lamp, integrating with spaces in perfect harmony: compact and discreet, its neutral finishes further enhance its ability to blend into its surroundings, almost disappearing to allow the light to take centre stage, fostering and enriching its interplay with the space.

									
					
						
The understated, minimalist design draws on the clean, rigorous lines of contemporary architecture, softened by subtly rounded corners. The entirely black internal structure enhances the power of the light beam – exceeding 5,000 lm in the Large version – and ensures uniform light distribution and high quality, while the LED source is strategically positioned to amplify the luminous effect and prevent unwanted shadows on the walls.
 
Crafted from aluminium, Shift is available in two sizes – Small and Large – and four sophisticated finishes: matte black, matte white, extra-matte champagne, and the new natural brown. These finishes are designed to complement various settings while accentuating the lamp’s clean and essential lines. Shift is equipped with two interchangeable screens that adjust the light’s perception and angle: it comes pre-assembled with a transparent screen, which can be easily replaced with a sandblasted screen to create a more diffused wall effect and reduce light projection onto the ceiling.
 
Thanks to its high luminous output, Shift can effectively illuminate medium-sized spaces on its own. From hotel bedrooms to residential living areas, it creates captivating interactions between light and space, offering high-performance lighting solutions with a sophisticated yet understated presence. Shift is also ideal for stairwells and corridors, where it can be installed in sequences, as well as in rooms with low ceilings or exposed beams that deserve to be highlighted.
 
The lamp is available with both DALI and TRIAC drivers, ensuring greater flexibility to suit various needs.","","","taxable","","1","","","0","0","","","","","1","","","","Collections, Wall","lodes","","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Shift-Wall-07.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Shift-Wall-08.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Shift-Wall-05.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Shift-Wall-06.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Shift-Wall-03.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Shift-Wall-04.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Shift-Wall-01.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Shift-Wall-02.jpg","","","","","","","","","0","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Shift-large-2D.pdf","52 variants available"

				Inspired by the function of the jam cleats found in sailing boats, Cima —a nautical rope in Italian— is a “suspended” lamp characterised by a ceiling-to-floor rope, a sleek and highly functional design element. A joint that holds the lamp body slides vertically along the rope, while the counterweight allows to manage any excess rope. The simple cylindrical shapes and the black colour of these elements highlight the three brilliant finishes of the rope, vibrant accents to suit any interiors and décor mood.

									
					
						Cima is a “suspended” lamp, conceived as a practical lighting solution that can be rapidly altered to meet the needs of those who use it. Cima’s hallmark is a ceiling-to-floor rope, a graphic and functional element with an eyelet that allows it to be fixed to the ceiling. An injection moulded polymer joint slides vertically along the rope and locks at any desired point. The lamp body resting on the joint swivels to bring light where it is needed. The counterweight enables to readjust any excess of rope for lower ceilings. The switch button is placed on the power cord for easy use.
 
With their cylindrical shapes and sophisticated yet technical textured black finish, the lamp body, the joint and the counterweight accentuate the colours of the rope —gold, yellow or silver. The versatility of configuration and the GU10 commercial light bulb socket make Cima a flexible lamp that can be adapted to the lighting needs of any environment. With Cima, lighting can be easily shared and regulated, creating a sense of inclusiveness within the light wavelength range.","","","taxable","","1","","","0","0","","","","","1","","","","Collections, Floor","lodes","","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cima-01.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cima-02.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cima-04.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cima-05.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cima-06.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cima-07.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cima-08.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cima-09.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cima-10.jpg","","","","","","","","","0","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/173IS70E0001_Rev00_CE_PRINT.pdf","7 variants available"

				As light as a breath, Blow is an ethereal and original table lamp. Made from blown glass, it contains a bright LED module that can be directed inside the diffuser to create ever-different beams of light. Perfect for reading or furnishing personal and intimate spaces. 
									
					
						Like a transparent, floating bubble, Blow is the result of just that, blowing, becoming an elegant table lamp with directional light. Designed by Pio e Tito Toso, it’s made from blown glass, offering poetic beauty to its soft form, enhanced by the LED light inside, animated by a simple and fluid gesture. The chrome metal base with a 10 cm diameter supports a mobile arm on which the light source is mounted, which can be directed at will by shifting the magnet on the outside of the diffuser.

				IVY is a minimal, geometric lighting piece composed of a ring hanging on a cable, which gives power to a made to measure LED module. Designed with single and double cables (IVY I and IVY V respectively), IVY responds to the need for flexibility, an increasingly contemporary theme in architectural practice and restoration, allowing the luminaire to be released from its ceiling derivation.

									
					
						
The name IVY relates to the clustering of lamps on numerous cables that are reminiscent of climbing branches. The cables intertwine and overlap in the same way as the plant ivy, adapting to the environment and framing certain details of the space. The composition emphasises various focal points from different or changing points of view of those who walk through the room.
 
The design was also inspired by rings, specifically wedding rings, as pendants on necklaces. This motif translates to the ring’s position on the double cable, reinforcing it as a simple yet precious object, making the perfection of its form the value.
 
IVY I is a single pendant lamp with a single cable supporting the ring, which can be used on its own or in compositions on Lodes canopies.
 
IVY V, on the other hand, opens new territory with its new canopy. IVY V features a double cable which forms a V by hanging the cable from the power source in the ceiling to wherever users decide to fix it. IVY V can also be used on a new multiple canopy that consists of a base with a central hole from which up to 6 or 12 cables hang. Users can create several V shapes, starting from the canopy and positioning the cable wherever they want around the room, securing it to the ceiling through a small black metal element.
 
The cable is black, while the die-cast zinc alloy ring comes in three finishes: matte black, extra-matte champagne and terra. IVY sheds light downward through a long and narrow opening, which has been skilfully designed to disseminate an even, rounded beam through its methacrylate diffuser.
 
IVY is a true space architecture project, with the cables becoming a graphic sign that defines the space.","","","taxable","","1","","","0","0","","","","","1","","","","Collections, Suspension","lodes","","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IVY-01.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IVY-06.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IVY-07.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IVY-V_terra_-12-lights-on-central-canopy.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IVY-V_-matte-black-on-6-lights-central-canopy.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IVY-V_black.jpg","","","","","","","","","0","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/178IS20E0001_Rev03_CE_PRINT.pdf","22 variants available"

The sheet is laid out in especially flat designed packaging to avoid excess waste, allowing for the lowest possible environmental footprint. The shade can then be easily assembled by the customer thanks to a plastic film that allows the two ends to be joined together.
 
Available as a table or floor lamp, Hover is available as a table lamp at 51.5cm tall or a floor lamp at 149.2cm. The series suits different uses such as on a desk, side table or next to a sofa. The floor lamp could also be used for public spaces including an airport lounge, a hotel room or lobby.","","","taxable","","1","","","0","0","","","","","1","","","","Collections, Floor","lodes","","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Hover-02.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Hover-05.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Hover-06.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Hover-1.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Hover_det_USB_RGB.jpg","","","","","","","","","0","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Hover-Floor-2D.pdf","4 variants available"

				Volum Outdoor is the blown-glass sphere from the Lodes indoor collection, reimagined for outdoor use. Its poetic compositions extend the narrative of 360° lighting, expressing the fluidity of contemporary living and the seamless continuity between indoor and outdoor spaces, creating a harmonious dialogue between living rooms and gardens, and between dining rooms and terraces.

									
					
						
The diffuser spheres, similar in shape yet intimately different, celebrate minimalist elegance and the ancient art of glassblowing – a technique that creates naturally imperfect and always unique forms. Thanks to their special glossy finish, the lamps radiate light evenly and gently, creating refined atmospheres that enhance the surrounding architecture and evoke feelings of wellbeing, enriching moments of relaxation and conviviality outdoors.
 
Available in four sizes, they provide decorative lighting solutions for walls and ceilings, adding both light and value to porches, loggias, terraces, and other covered outdoor areas. Its compositional versatility allows for custom installations – from a single sphere as a light source above a dining table for summer dinners and aperitifs, to groupings that guide the gaze along porches and verandas.","","","taxable","","1","","","0","0","","","","","1","","","","Outdoor","lodes","","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Lodes-Outdoor-Volum-4.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Lodes-Outdoor-Volum-1.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Lodes-Outdoor-Volum-2-1.jpg","","","","","","","","","0","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/209IS40E0001_Rev02_CE_print.pdf","29 variants available"

				Tidal is an elegant collection of lamps with exceptional luminous efficiency. Its fluid, impactful design, inspired by the movements of celestial bodies and tides, creates a dynamic visual experience – appearing differently from various viewing angles thanks to the ring’s irregular, asymmetrical shape, with one side wider than the other. Tidal emits light both downward and upward, with all technical elements concealed within the compact, slim lamp body, highlighting its aesthetic appeal.

									
					
						
Initially conceived as a ceiling lamp, Tidal is now also available as a suspension lamp: in multiple sizes* – a 45, 60, and 75 cm for ceiling versions, and 60 cm for suspension versions – and in four versatile matte finishes, allowing it to illuminate and enhance any environment. It can be used solo or in compositions, playing with the collection’s various functions and sizes. The new stand-alone suspension option is perfect for lighting tables, including larger ones, in both residential and food & beverage settings.

				The name Elara connotes astronomy and Greek mythology, and its geometric design mimicks the trajectory of the planets within the universe. Inspired by astral motion, the lamp is characterised by two metal rings, one of which can be set at various angles to produce fluidity and movement, as well as a small sphere at the bottom of the lamp that contains the light source.
 
The light source emits a glow that can illuminate an entire room. Additionally, users can direct the bi-emission sphere – up or down – according to the need for light. The two sources have different light emissions: 2100 lumens and 800 lumens for the 2700 K version or 2260 lumens and 845 lumens for the 3000 K.

									
					
						
The central ring can be positioned to reach different heights and angles, allowing users to experiment with casting light and shadows. Elara features a dimmer controlled with the wall-mounted power switch, allowing users to modulate the intensity of the light to create their ideal lighting scheme.
 
Available in two sizes, medium (Ø60 cm) and large (Ø 80cm), Elara suits a range of environments, such as over a dining table in a residential setting, or as part of a larger installation in public spaces like a hotel lounge or restaurant.","","","taxable","","1","","","0","0","","","","","1","","","","Collections, Suspension","lodes","","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Elara-01.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Elara-15.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Elara-2025-01.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Elara_gold_1_RGB.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Elara-05.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Elara-11.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Elara-14.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Elara-04.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Elara_A_large_blackRGB.jpg","","","","","","","","","0","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/206IS20E0001_Rev02_CE_print.pdf","18 variants available"

				Stitch is a family of outdoor lanterns with a strong decorative character that evokes the feeling of summer and the light emotions associated with a beach at sunset. Inspired by the world of weaving and materials, it recalls the elegant gesture of basting – used to join fabric pieces with temporary stitches before sewing them permanently.

									
					
						
A technical outdoor fabric ribbon is woven into the metal cage with a soft movement that creates sophisticated plays of shadow and transparency that diffuse throughout the environment: the irregular, imperfect weave conceals the light source while visually lightening the lantern’s volume thanks to the light flowing between the threads, enhancing the material’s texture.
 
Stitch is available in four finishes designed to enhance its decorative character and suit different styles and settings. Each colour, ranging from delicate to intense shades, helps define the product’s identity and the atmosphere of the space: anthracite, sober and refined, blends naturally with contemporary or minimalist furnishings; soft ivory offers a light visual effect, ideal for bright environments; red clay evokes the warmth of earthy materials, harmonising with rough surfaces, wood, and exposed brick; and dark olive green, deep and enveloping, is inspired by the plant world to lend outdoor spaces a more sophisticated character.","","","taxable","","1","","","0","0","","","","","1","","","","Outdoor","lodes","","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Lodes-Outdoor-Stitch-7.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Lodes-Outdoor-Stitch-8.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Lodes-Outdoor-Stitch-1.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Lodes-Outdoor-Stitch-2-1.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Lodes-Outdoor-Stitch-4.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Lodes-Outdoor-Stitch-5.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Lodes-Outdoor-Stitch-6-1.jpg","","","","","","","","","0","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Stitch-Large-Floor-2D.pdf","85 variants available"

				A simple form that delivers the light to wherever it’s needed, enhancing the space. Tubular and slim, A-Tube is a versatile lamp, available in different sizes and finishes, that can be fixed directly to the ceiling, suspended singularly, or used in cluster compositions to create impactful lighting effects.

									
					
						A-Tube is a lamp characterised by an elegant, cylindrical design, perfect for illuminating specific points and furnishing with dynamic essentiality. Available in two versions, ceiling and suspension, it can be used either singularly or to create lively compositions distinguished by their differing lengths and finishes (matte white, matte black and coppery bronze). As a central feature with multiform lighting, in a neat row over a bench or in a rhythmic succession of different sized lines, A-Tube illuminates, becoming one with the interior architecture.
 
The aluminium body of A-Tube, with a diameter of 6 cm, is 4 mm thick, making it both solid and resilient. Inside, its structure is designed to house a GU10 lamp that diffuses direct light. The ceiling version, available in four sizes (14, 30, 60, 100 cm), can easily be fixed with a simple metal attachment.

				Focus is a multifunctional projector inspired by the world of photography, both in its lines and design, with details that evoke analogue cameras – from the graduated scale engraved on the body, reminiscent of focal lengths, to the front ring that echoes the historic models of Leica and Pentax.

									
					
						
The name Focus refers to the action of ‘focusing’ typical of photography, but also extends to the concept of precisely directing light to shape it and create atmospheres, expressing a design that combines aesthetics, functionality, and attention to detail.
The joint, often relegated to a purely functional role, becomes a central element: it allows the projector to be rotated to optimise the lighting effect, while the goniometer with degree indication acts as a guide for adjusting the angle of inclination, recalling the precision of photographic tripods.
 
Available in three sizes, the lamp body houses a high-output LED source that allows the light beam to be customised thanks to the three optics available – Spot, Medium and Extra Wide – to achieve focused or diffused effects according to design requirements. The lighting effect can be further personalised with optional internal or external optical accessories – Honeycomb, Half-moon glare shield, Snoot – which emphasise the dynamic character of the design and its interaction with the user.
 
Five finishes – black, anthracite, natural brown, natural green and champagne – ranging from neutral shades to blend into any context to more intense colours to discreetly enhance the design of the projector, make it suitable for various architectural and landscaping applications, offering lighting designers and architects flexible and tailor-made solutions.","","","taxable","","1","","","0","0","","","","","1","","","","Outdoor","lodes","","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Lodes-Outdoor-Focus-7.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Lodes-Outdoor-Focus-8.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Lodes-Outdoor-Focus-9.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Lodes-Outdoor-Focus-10.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Lodes-Outdoor-Focus-1.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Lodes-Outdoor-Focus-2.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Lodes-Outdoor-Focus-3.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Lodes-Outdoor-Focus-4.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Lodes-Outdoor-Focus-5.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Lodes-Outdoor-Focus-6.jpg","","","","","","","","","0","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Focus-SpecSheets.pdf","187 variants available"

				MAP is a ceiling and wall lighting system that redefines the boundaries of traditional modular lighting solutions. Developed in collaboration with the Berlin-based design studio GECKELER MICHELS, it strikes a balance between dynamic aesthetics and advanced lighting performance. The distinctive graphic feature of the design is a fabric tape, stretched between the various modules, which powers the entire system, creating endless compositional possibilities. Like a map that reconfigures spaces and evokes luminous constellations, MAP allows the free positioning of light points, creating rhythms and compositions that illuminate and adorn any environment.

									
					
						
The versatility of the system makes it ideal for environments with architectural constraints, such as masonry ceilings or the absence of central lighting points, ensuring optimal light distribution without major structural modifications. From the starting module, the fabric tape – fitted with specific conductors – is stretched between the various light points, passing through the body of each module to continuously power the entire system, always concealing the origin of the power supply.","","","taxable","","1","","","0","0","","","","","1","","","","Collections, Ceiling","lodes","","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MAP-21.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MAP-22.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MAP-23.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MAP-24.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MAP-25.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MAP-1.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MAP-10.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MAP-11.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MAP-12.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MAP-13.jpg","","","","","","","","","0","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lodes-MAP-Technical-info-2.pdf","193 variants available"

				Reed transforms a simple post into a lighting solution that blends seamlessly into the natural environment, nestled among low vegetation and bushes, creating a visual and emotional narrative that restores light to its leading role as a source of comfort and wellbeing.

									
					
						
Its name reveals its inspiration: a slender, vertical metal stem emerging from ground like a plant, ready to illuminate with quiet elegance, whether alone or in compositions.
 
The stem can be paired with three organically shaped diffusers – two flattened sphere versions inspired by the delicacy of dandelion flowers, and an elongated one reminiscent of the lightness of slender stalks – designed to blend naturally into the landscape and compose evocative lighting scenes. Each configuration interacts with the surrounding environment, creating atmospheres where light, shadows, and shapes merge to convey the impression of a natural extension of the vegetation itself.
 
Available in three stem heights and four finishes – anthracite, natural brown, natural green, and champagne – Reed is designed for direct ground installation. A portion of the stem, buried and hidden after installation, allows it to be freely tilted to camouflage itself within the greenery and gently diffuse light, enhancing textures, volumes, and details with great delicacy.
 
Reed is the ideal solution for outdoor settings that foster a strong connection between nature, light, and architecture. In residential areas and green spaces of hotels and commercial buildings, it enhances paths, garden edges, and terraces with a discreet yet decorative presence that promotes an aesthetic balance of sensory emotion and visual wellbeing. It also adds a sober and elegant touch to parks and courtyards, where it harmoniously integrates among shrubs and bushes, becoming part of the landscape itself to create lighting scenes in harmony with the vegetation and architectural context.","","","taxable","","1","","","0","0","","","","","1","","","","Outdoor","lodes","","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Lodes-Outdoor-Reed-5-1.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Lodes-Outdoor-Reed-6.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Lodes-Outdoor-Reed-1-1.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Lodes-Outdoor-Reed-2-1.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Lodes-Outdoor-Reed-3.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Lodes-Outdoor-Reed-4.jpg","","","","","","","","","0","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/806IS90E0001_Rev00_CE_print.pdf","153 variants available"

				Created in collaboration with Needs Studio, Tidal is an elegant collection of lamps with exceptional luminous efficiency. Their fluid and impactful design captures the essence of the movements of celestial bodies, waves, and tides. The lamps appear different depending on how they are viewed from below, thanks to the rings’ irregular, asymmetrical shape, with one side wider than the other. Available in two configurations – ceiling-mounted and pendant – Tidal integrates seamlessly into diverse settings, from residential to professional environments and even contract projects. It offers lighting solutions that illuminate and decorate, whether used individually or in repetition, while exploring the interplay of the collection’s various configurations and dimensions.
 

									
					
						
 
In the stand-alone pendant version, the lamp’s main body has been redesigned with a double-shell structure that balances direct and indirect light emission, preventing glare. This design adds an extra sense of twist and dynamism to the ring, which appears to hover in the air with a light, refined presence, transforming any space with its soft, dynamic lighting effect.
 
The lamp’s compact body, with its limited thickness, houses a powerful light source delivering over 6,000 lm. Light is projected simultaneously upwards and downwards, achieving a perfect 50-50 balance between direct and indirect illumination. The intensity of both light sources can be controlled through dual switching.
 
The lamp is suspended by three thin cables anchored to a circular ceiling canopy specifically designed for this suspension. Made of matte metal in two finishes, white or black, it has a slightly smaller diameter than the ring, blending into the space and creating the impression of floating within the ceiling – thin and light.
 
In this version, Tidal is available in two models: a standard suspension with cables approximately 4 m long, and a suspension with an adjustable rise and fall mechanism. The rise and fall version allows the suspension cable length to be adjusted up to 1.5 m from the ceiling. By simply grasping the lamp body with both hands, it can be raised or lowered to the desired height. This flexibility lets users freely adapt the lighting to suit the needs of any environment, changing the atmosphere without the need to reposition the lamp.
 
A single size – 60 cm in diameter – is available in the four matte finishes that characterise the family: white, earth, champagne, and black. This versatility makes Tidal suitable for a wide range of applications, whether used individually or in repetition, depending on the length of the surface to be illuminated. The rise and fall variant is particularly well-suited for the F&B and hospitality sectors, as it allows the lamp height to be quickly and easily adjusted to accommodate different table configurations, from intimate settings for two to larger groups.
The lamp is available with both DALI and TRIAC drivers, ensuring greater flexibility to suit various needs.
 
*Currently, the rise and fall variant is not available in the North American market.","","","taxable","","1","","","0","0","","","","","1","","","","Collections, Suspension","lodes","","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Tidal-Suspension-07.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Tidal-Suspension-08.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Tidal-Suspension-01.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Tidal-Suspension-02.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Tidal-Suspension-04.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Tidal-Suspension-05.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Tidal-Suspension-06.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tidal-suspension-72-RGB-3.jpg","","","","","","","","","0","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/231IS20E0002_Rev01_CE.pdf","108 variants available"

				A-Tube Nano is a suspension lamps which interprets light in its simplest form by creating a thin luminous line in the living spaces. At the lower end of the lightweight aluminium structure, a transparent methacrylate diffuser houses an LED module whose light creates a soft, welcoming atmosphere. The three sizes and seven statement finishes allow to create clusters of evocative lighting. Black cable version is also available.
 
The simple, linear, pin-like look of the A-Tube Nano suspension light is also highly sophisticated and effective. The lightweight aluminium structure with a 2 cm diameter delicately defines the atmosphere of the room in which it is featured. The small methacrylate diffuser highlights the linear look and lets the light create an accent in the living space.

									
					
						
Elegantly suspended from the power cord, the quintessential simplicity of the line accentuates A-Tube’s intrinsic strength. This simplicity allows the creation of a wide variety of compositions thanks to the lamps’ three different sizes, small, medium and large and seven finishes, glossy (Chrome, Rose Gold, Gold and Terra) or matte (White, Black and Champagne).
 
The 3W LED source with a colour rendering index (CRI) of 90, fitted in a methacrylate diffuser, emanates a soft, warm light which highlights the natural colours of objects. On its own, A-Tube Nano guarantees excellent lighting over a table for two people and is also ideal for conjuring up an intimate conversation setting for romantic dinners.

A metal suspension lamp with an LED light source projected toward a convex lens—simple and effective, elegant and extremely bright, to be used either independently or as a design composition.

									
					
						Inspired by the lightness of spring rain, Rain interprets the movement of the drop, capturing the specific moment, suspending it in space and time. Simple and linear, its form enhances the LED light, projecting it toward a convex lens. The aluminium body is available in two finishes, chrome and matte black, which can be matched with five different accents (coppery bronze, brushed chrome, gold, rose gold, matte black). Singularly, it is perfect for minimal furnishing insofar as it creates a scenic and specific light source, for example on a bedside table. Installed as a cluster with up to 36 monochromatic or coloured elements, Rain gives life to spectacular compositions distinguished by their dynamic and original character.
 
Rain is suspended from a thin power cord, up to 4 metres long. The diffuser, a convex glass lens, houses a 7 W LED module that can provides either warmer (2700 K) or colder (3000 K) light. The lens projects direct light without glare, with a colour rendering index (CRI) of 90, reflecting the natural colour of objects without distorting them.

Available in two sizes, it functions as a step light in the more compact version and as a floor washer in the Ø140 model, which provides greater visual impact and higher light output.

									
					
						
Designed to create refined lighting effects in outdoor environments, Chelsie provides uniform, enveloping illumination that softens contrasts and enhances the natural perception of space.
 
The metal lamp body, sober and with no visible screws, features an open beam with high output that ensures effective, even lighting, while the light source is completely concealed by a gentle recess – the design’s signature graphic feature. Patrick Norguet’s design leaves room for decorative appeal, without sacrificing the technical function and formal clarity that characterise this type of outdoor lamp.

				Round, compact forms featuring elegant finishes with a centre that shines like a precious stone. Once lit up, Bugia amazes with the unexpected effect of its light. A surprising and harmonious balance between direct and indirect light, diffused both downward and up toward the ceiling. A rich family of ceiling lights, in Single, Double, Triple and now also Mega versions.

									
					
						Bugia is a compact ceiling lamp characterised by the minimalist design of its diffuser, embellished by shiny and sophisticated finishes. When lit, it catches the eye, diffusing a soft light throughout the entire space; not only downward from the crystal lens, but also – unexpectedly – up toward the ceiling, through a side diffuser in opaline polycarbonate. Either single or in a composition of multiple light sources, Bugia is ideal for lighting up any sized space, perfectly catering to any type of style thanks to the three available finishes: white, chrome and glossy copper.
 
Bugia Single is supported by a metal structure fixed to the ceiling with magnets, while the Double, Triple and Mega versions are supported by a round closure element in the same colour as the diffuser. Bugia Mega amplifies the size of Triple while keeping its proportions unchanged and adopts a lens with a 30% larger diameter that increases light distribution. The 15 W LED light can be selected in either a warmer (2700 K) or colder (3000 K) light colour temperature*. The colour rendering index (CRI) of 90 mirrors the true colour of objects without distorting them.
 
The characteristic lightweight and slim form of Bugia blends in with its surrounds, offering elegant notes of light, making it perfect for any living space, from the living room to the bedroom. And now, thanks to the Mega version, Bugia decorates and illuminates larger sized interiors as well.

Kelly is a multifaceted family of suspension and wall lamps that stand out with elegance in any living space thanks to the variety of available forms and finishes.

									
					
						Strong geometric forms and lightweight clusters characterised by special laser cuts that make way for a dynamic play of light and shadow. Made in metal, thanks to their distinct patterns, Kelly suspension and wall lamps are eye-catching even when off, becoming decorative objects that personalise the space.
 
The graphic pattern is the common denominator in this variegated family of lamps. Shaped like a dome, Kelly Dome features a lightweight lampshade with a strong visual impact. Available in three sizes – 50, 60 and 80 cm – and in four elegant finishes, it is particularly suited for lighting up the dining table or to create atmosphere in the living room. The contemporary style of Kelly Sphere, similarly available in three different sizes – 40, 50 and 80 cm – emanates a sense of simplicity and lightness with a touch of magic. In the wall version featured with a width of 25 cm, Kelly helps to create a warm and welcoming atmosphere even in the smallest of spaces.
 
Kelly Dome and Kelly Sphere are suspended from the ceiling by way of three steel cables that keep them perfectly balanced. Inside, a semi-transparent glass diffuser in glossy milk white is designed to house E27 lamps (not included). The wall version includes a 16W LED source with warm light and colour rendering index (CRI) of 92. An attractive and highly functional family of lamps, which harmonise living areas with plays of light in an exclusive balance of full and empty spaces.","","","taxable","","1","","","0","0","","","","","1","","","","Collections, Suspension","lodes","","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kelly-07.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kelly-08.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kelly-09-1.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kelly-17.jpg","","","","","","","","","0","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IST-14102_Rev01_CE_PRINT.pdf","21 variants available"
