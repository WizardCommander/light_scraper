				Una bellezza seducente dalla personalità audace grazie a tagli laser forti e precisi che alleggeriscono il metallo del paralume e creano un intrigante gioco di luci e ombre. Kelly è una famiglia poliedrica di lampade a sospensione e a parete che si distingue con eleganza in ogni ambiente abitativo grazie alla varietà di forme e finiture disponibili.

									
					
						Forme geometriche decise e insieme leggere, caratterizzate da particolari tagli a laser che danno vita ad un dinamico gioco di luci e ombre. Realizzate in metallo, con il loro preciso segno grafico le lampade Kelly a sospensione e a parete affascinano anche da spente, diventando oggetti di arredo che personalizzano l’ambiente.
 
Il motivo grafico accomuna questa variegata famiglia di lampade. A forma di cupola, Kelly Dome ha un paralume leggero dal forte impatto scenografico. Disponibile in tre dimensioni – 50, 60 e 80 cm – e in quattro raffinate finiture, è particolarmente adatta per illuminare un tavolo da pranzo o per creare interesse in una zona living. Lo stile contemporaneo di Kelly Sphere, anch’essa declinata in tre dimensioni – 40, 50 e 80 cm – trasmette una sensazione di semplicità e leggerezza con un tocco di magia. Nella versione a parete, con i suoi 25 cm di larghezza Kelly contribuisce a creare un’atmosfera calda e accogliente anche in spazi più contenuti.
 
Kelly Dome e Kelly Sphere sono sospese al soffitto tramite tre cavetti in acciaio che le mantengono perfettamente bilanciate. Al loro interno, un diffusore in vetro semitrasparente color bianco latte lucido è predisposto per ospitare lampadine E27 (non incluse). La versione da parete include un LED da 16 W dalla luce calda con indice di resa cromatica (CRI) pari a 92. Una famiglia di lampade attraenti e funzionali, che armonizzano gli spazi abitativi con giochi di luce, in un originale equilibrio di pieni e di vuoti.","","","taxable","","1","","","0","0","","","","","1","","","","Collezioni, Sospensioni","lodes","","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kelly-18.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kelly-05-1.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kelly-16.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kelly_medium-dome_matte-white.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kelly-14.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kelly-13.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kelly-15.jpg","","","","","","","","","0","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Kelly_dome.pdf","Kelly small dome 50, Kelly medium dome 60, Kelly large dome 80"

				A simple form that delivers the light to wherever it’s needed, enhancing the space. Tubular and slim, A-Tube is a versatile lamp, available in different sizes and finishes, that can be fixed directly to the ceiling, suspended singularly, or used in cluster compositions to create impactful lighting effects.

									
					
						A-Tube is a lamp characterised by an elegant, cylindrical design, perfect for illuminating specific points and furnishing with dynamic essentiality. Available in two versions, ceiling and suspension, it can be used either singularly or to create lively compositions distinguished by their differing lengths and finishes (matte white, matte black and coppery bronze). As a central feature with multiform lighting, in a neat row over a bench or in a rhythmic succession of different sized lines, A-Tube illuminates, becoming one with the interior architecture.
 
The aluminium body of A-Tube, with a diameter of 6 cm, is 4 mm thick, making it both solid and resilient. Inside, its structure is designed to house a GU10 lamp that diffuses direct light. The ceiling version, available in four sizes (14, 30, 60, 100 cm), can easily be fixed with a simple metal attachment. The suspension version comes in three different lengths, 30, 60 and 100 cm, which can be used as single pendants or combined on canopies to create multiple compositions.","","","taxable","","1","","","0","0","","","","","1","","","","Collections, Cluster suspension","lodes","","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A-Tube-4.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/A-Tube-3.jpg","","","","","","","","","0","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/096IS10E0001_Rev03_CE_PRINT.pdf","A-Tube small, A-Tube medium, A-Tube large"

				Nostalgia with its retro flair, Nostalgia elegantly tells of ancient glass blowing practices in three sinuous forms that can be combined at will. The perfection of the glass, the innovative LED technology and five elegant finishes make Nostalgia an extremely modern and versatile lamp that lends itself to the creation of captivating atmospheres, whether on or off. Available with a black frame and cable or chrome and transparent cable for all finishes, these combinations offer wide-ranging possibilities to personalize any space: on its own to illuminate a table or to add a sophisticated touch to a bedroom, in linear groups above a counter or peninsula, or in cluster compositions to emphasise larger spaces with refined scenic effects.","","","taxable","","1","","","0","0","","","","","1","","","","Collections, Cluster suspension","lodes","","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Nostalgia-01.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Nostalgia-11.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Nostalgia-22.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Nostalgia_medium-and-small_rose-gold-and-clear_black-cable_RGB.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Nostalgia_small_glossy-smoke_-wall-canopy.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Nostalgia-02.jpg","","","","","","","","","0","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/154IS10E0001_Rev02_CE_PRINT.pdf","Nostalgia small, Nostalgia medium, Nostalgia large"

				Rain falls from the ceiling like a drop of spring rain, with a linear movement that accentuates the curvaceous conical forms of its body. A metal suspension lamp with an LED light source projected toward a convex lens—simple and effective, elegant and extremely bright, to be used either independently or as a design composition.

									
					
						Inspired by the lightness of spring rain, Rain interprets the movement of the drop, capturing the specific moment, suspending it in space and time. Simple and linear, its form enhances the LED light, projecting it toward a convex lens. The aluminium body is available in two finishes, chrome and matte black, which can be matched with five different accents (coppery bronze, brushed chrome, gold, rose gold, matte black). Singularly, it is perfect for minimal furnishing insofar as it creates a scenic and specific light source, for example on a bedside table. Installed as a cluster with up to 36 monochromatic or coloured elements, Rain gives life to spectacular compositions distinguished by their dynamic and original character.
 
Rain is suspended from a thin power cord, up to 4 metres long. The diffuser, a convex glass lens, houses a 7 W LED module that can provides either warmer (2700 K) or colder (3000 K) light. The lens projects direct light without glare, with a colour rendering index (CRI) of 90, reflecting the natural colour of objects without distorting them. A sophisticated lamp, featuring a diameter of just 8.5 cm, which offers powerful lighting capable of enhancing the space and creating the perfect atmosphere.","","","taxable","","1","","","0","0","","","","","1","","","","Collections, Cluster suspension","lodes","","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Sky-Fall-01-1.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Sky-Fall-02-1.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Sky-Fall-05-1.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Rain_matte-black-black-cable-and-black-structure.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Rain-03-22.jpg|https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Rain-01-22.jpg","","","","","","","","","0","https://www.lodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/156IS10E0001_Rev02_CE_PRINT.pdf","Rain"
